          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            We may, from time to time, send you emails regarding new products and Services that we feel may interest you. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally call or send you direct mail about products and Services that may be of interest to you.

If you do not want to receive solicitations from us, you can "opt-out" by accessing your account online and editing your account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.
